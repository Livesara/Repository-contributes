# App47 Android PhoneGap example

## Installation

This is a sample PhoneGap project for Android; consequently, you can clone this repo and open it in Eclipse. 
This App makes use of the App47 SDK (via the [App47 PhoneGap plugin](https://github.com/App47/phonegap-plugins)) for 
mobile analytics including sessions, timed events, generic events, and logging. What's more, this project uses App configurations, 
which allow for runtime updates of desired variables, etc. 

Files to pay attention to:

* `GravyActivity.java` -- the App47 Agent is initialized
* `gravy.js` -- included via `index.html` and is where App47 PhoneGap plug is utilized
